# Tailwind Project

This project is a portfolio website that I initially created, and it is available here [ https://samahabdalrahman.github.io/Osaka-Portfolio-Template-by-samah/ ].
As part of my learning journey to enhance my skills, I rebuilt the project using Tailwind CSS. This allowed me to explore and solidify my knowledge of utility-first CSS frameworks.
